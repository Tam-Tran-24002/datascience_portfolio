There are two datasets in the Data folder that will be used to learn regression.
1. New York City bicycle routes through bridges
2. Idaho Falls Chukars (Pioneer League Baseball) data to find the optimal amount of pitches to throw out a batter based on the teamID (player is a trench goal).

Overview:
XGBoost Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm that builds an ensemble of decision trees to predict continuous values. It is optimized for speed and performance using gradient boosting techniques.

Definition
XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is an advanced implementation of gradient boosting designed for efficiency and accuracy. It improves predictions by sequentially training trees while correcting previous errors. The key components include:  

* Boosting Trees: A collection of decision trees built sequentially to reduce errors.  
* Gradient Descent Optimization: Adjusts model weights using the gradient of a loss function.  
* Regularization: Controls model complexity to prevent overfitting.  

For regression, XGBoost predicts continuous values by minimizing a chosen loss function, commonly Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Key Concepts
1. Boosting Mechanism:  
   - Unlike a single decision tree, XGBoost builds multiple trees in sequence.  
   - Each new tree corrects the errors of the previous ones by focusing on residuals.  

2. Loss Functions:  
   - Determines how errors are measured and minimized.  
   - Common choices:  
     * Mean Squared Error (MSE) – Penalizes larger errors more heavily.  
     * Mean Absolute Error (MAE) – Treats all errors equally.  
     * Huber Loss – A mix of MSE and MAE to handle outliers.  

3. Regularization Techniques:  
   - Prevents overfitting by adding penalties to complex models.  
   - L1 Regularization (Lasso) – Shrinks coefficients, promoting sparsity.  
   - L2 Regularization (Ridge) – Penalizes large coefficients to reduce variance.  

4. Feature Importance & Selection:  
   - XGBoost ranks features by importance, aiding feature selection.  
   - Can be used to eliminate redundant or irrelevant features.

Pros 
1. High Performance – Optimized for speed, scalability, and efficiency.  
2. Handles Missing Data – Automatically learns how to deal with missing values.  
3. Regularization Built-in – Reduces overfitting with L1 and L2 penalties.  
4. Works Well with Large Datasets – Efficient memory usage and parallel processing.

Cons 
1. Complexity – More difficult to tune compared to simpler models.  
2. Computationally Intensive – Training can be slow on very large datasets.  
3. Sensitive to Hyperparameters – Performance depends on careful tuning of learning rate, tree depth, and regularization.

Tips 
* Optimize Hyperparameters – Use grid search or Bayesian optimization for tuning.  
* Use Early Stopping – Stops training if performance stops improving on validation data.  
* Scale Features if Needed – Although XGBoost can handle unscaled data, standardization may help in some cases.  
* Leverage Feature Importance – Identify and remove less relevant features to improve efficiency.
