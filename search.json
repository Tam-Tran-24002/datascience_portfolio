    "text": "This folder’s purpose is to give an example of using KNN machine learning model.\nFoundation datset: iris dataset Stretch dataset: the Heart diseases - UCI (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease).\nK-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a supervised machine learning algorithm commonly used for classification and regression tasks. It’s one of the simplest and most intuitive models in machine learning.\n\nDefinition: KNN works by finding the ‘k’ closest data points (neighbors) to a given input based on some distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance). The predicted value or class is determined by these neighbors:\n\nFor classification, the input is assigned the class most common among its neighbors (majority vote).\nFor regression, the predicted value is the average (or sometimes weighted average) of the neighbors’ values.\n\n\nKey Concepts:\n\nK (Number of Neighbors): The algorithm uses ‘k’ neighbors to make predictions. Choosing the right ‘k’ is crucial:\n\n\nSmall ‘k’ (e.g., 1 or 3) makes the model sensitive to noise.\nLarge ‘k’ smooths out predictions but may overlook local patterns.\n\n\nDistance Metrics: Determines how “close” neighbors are. Common metrics include:\n\n\nEuclidean Distance: Straight-line distance between points.\nManhattan Distance: Distance measured along axes at right angles.\nCosine Similarity: Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors (useful for text or high-dimensional data).\n\n\nLaziness: KNN is a lazy learner, meaning it doesn’t learn a model during training. Instead, it stores the data and makes predictions when queried. This is why it’s called a “memory-based” approach.\n\nUseful Articles and Videos: * https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ml_knn.asp * https://realpython.com/knn-python/ * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/k-nearest-neighbor-algorithm-in-python/ * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQveSaMyEwM * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6uHw7QW_n4 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6bOBZX-1kY\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Overview\nXGBoost Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm that builds an ensemble of decision trees to predict continuous values. It is optimized for speed and performance using gradient boosting techniques.\n\n\n\nDefinition\nXGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is an advanced implementation of gradient boosting designed for efficiency and accuracy. It improves predictions by sequentially training trees while correcting previous errors. The key components include:\n\nBoosting Trees: A collection of decision trees built sequentially to reduce errors.\n\nGradient Descent Optimization: Adjusts model weights using the gradient of a loss function.\n\nRegularization: Controls model complexity to prevent overfitting.\n\nFor regression, XGBoost predicts continuous values by minimizing a chosen loss function, commonly Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE).\n\n\n\nKey Concepts\n1. Boosting Mechanism:\n- Unlike a single decision tree, XGBoost builds multiple trees in sequence.\n- Each new tree corrects the errors of the previous ones by focusing on residuals.\n\nLoss Functions:\n\nDetermines how errors are measured and minimized.\n\nCommon choices:\n\nMean Squared Error (MSE) – Penalizes larger errors more heavily.\n\nMean Absolute Error (MAE) – Treats all errors equally.\n\nHuber Loss – A mix of MSE and MAE to handle outliers.\n\n\nRegularization Techniques:\n\nPrevents overfitting by adding penalties to complex models.\n\nL1 Regularization (Lasso) – Shrinks coefficients, promoting sparsity.\n\nL2 Regularization (Ridge) – Penalizes large coefficients to reduce variance.\n\nFeature Importance & Selection:\n\nXGBoost ranks features by importance, aiding feature selection.\n\nCan be used to eliminate redundant or irrelevant features.\n\n\n\n\n\nPros\n1. High Performance – Optimized for speed, scalability, and efficiency.\n2. Handles Missing Data – Automatically learns how to deal with missing values.\n3. Regularization Built-in – Reduces overfitting with L1 and L2 penalties.\n4. Works Well with Large Datasets – Efficient memory usage and parallel processing.\n\n\n\nCons\n1. Complexity – More difficult to tune compared to simpler models.\n2. Computationally Intensive – Training can be slow on very large datasets.\n3. Sensitive to Hyperparameters – Performance depends on careful tuning of learning rate, tree depth, and regularization.\n\n\n\nTips\n* Optimize Hyperparameters – Use grid search or Bayesian optimization for tuning.\n* Use Early Stopping – Stops training if performance stops improving on validation data.\n* Scale Features if Needed – Although XGBoost can handle unscaled data, standardization may help in some cases.\n* Leverage Feature Importance – Identify and remove less relevant features to improve efficiency.\n\n\n\nUseful Articles and Videos\n* XGBoost Official Documentation\n* XGBoost for Regression – Machine Learning Mastery\n* Understanding XGBoost – Analytics Vidhya\n* XGBoost Explained – YouTube",

    "text": "Overview\nDecision Tree (DT) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It splits data into branches based on feature values to make predictions.\n\n\n\nDefinition\nA Decision Tree is a flowchart-like model where data is split into smaller subsets based on feature conditions. The structure consists of:\n\nRoot Node: The starting point that represents the entire dataset.\n\nDecision Nodes: Points where the data is split based on a feature.\n\nLeaves: Terminal nodes that provide the final prediction.\n\nFor classification, a Decision Tree assigns class labels based on feature splits.\nFor regression, it predicts continuous values using the average or mean of data points in each leaf.\n\n\n\nKey Concepts 1. Splitting Criteria:\n- Determines how the dataset is divided at each step.\n- Common methods: * Gini Impurity (Classification) – Measures the likelihood of incorrect classification.\n* Entropy (Classification) – Uses information gain to decide splits.\n* Mean Squared Error (MSE) (Regression) – Measures variance within nodes.\n\nTree Depth & Overfitting:\n\nDeeper trees fit training data better but may overfit.\n\nPruning (removing unnecessary branches) improves generalization.\n\nFeature Importance:\n\nDecision Trees rank features by their impact on predictions.\n\nHelps in feature selection for other models.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\n\nSome implementations allow surrogate splits to handle missing values.\n\n\n\n\n\nPros 1. Easy to Understand & Interpret – Can be visualized as a simple flowchart.\n2. No Need for Feature Scaling – Works with both categorical and numerical features.\n3. Handles Non-Linearity – Can model complex relationships without requiring transformation.\n4. Fast for Small Datasets – Training and inference are relatively quick.\n\n\n\nCons 1. Prone to Overfitting – Deep trees can memorize training data, reducing generalization.\n2. Unstable to Small Changes – Small variations in data can change the tree structure significantly.\n3. Less Efficient on Large Datasets – Computationally expensive for large datasets.\n\n\n\nTips * Limit Tree Depth – Use max_depth to prevent overfitting.\n* Pruning Techniques – Use pre-pruning (max_leaf_nodes) or post-pruning to remove unnecessary branches.\n* Use Feature Importance – Identify the most influential features and remove irrelevant ones.\n* Consider Ensemble Methods – Random Forest or Gradient Boosting improve Decision Trees by reducing variance.\n\n\n\nUseful Articles and Videos * https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/decision-tree-classification-python * https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/decision-trees * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DlWndLbk90 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOiBe-nrmc4",

    "section": "Overview of Random Forests",
    "text": "Overview of Random Forests\nRandom Forest (RF) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It builds multiple decision trees and combines their outputs for better accuracy and stability.\n\nDefinition\nA Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that creates a “forest” of decision trees during training. Instead of relying on a single tree, Random Forest combines the predictions of multiple trees to improve performance. The structure consists of:\n\nDecision Trees: Individual trees that make predictions based on subsets of data and features.\nBagging (Bootstrap Aggregating): Each tree is trained on a randomly sampled subset of the data.\nVoting/Averaging: Combines the predictions from all trees:\nFor classification, the majority vote decides the class.\nFor regression, the average of all tree predictions is used.\nRandom Forest reduces the risk of overfitting compared to individual decision trees and works well for both categorical and numerical data.\n\n\nKey Concepts\n\nBagging:\n\n\nRandom Forest uses bootstrapping to train each tree on a different sample of the data.\nThis creates diversity among trees, making the model more robust.\n\n\nFeature Randomness:\n\n\nAt each split, Random Forest considers a random subset of features rather than all features.\nThis reduces correlation between trees and improves generalization.\n\n\nOut-of-Bag (OOB) Error:\n\n\nTrees not trained on certain data points (left out during bootstrapping) can be used to validate the model.\nOOB error gives an unbiased estimate of model performance.\n\n\nFeature Importance:\n\n\nRandom Forest provides a ranking of feature importance based on how often features are used for splitting across trees.\nUseful for identifying key predictors in your data. \n\nPros\nImproved Accuracy – Combines multiple trees, reducing overfitting. Robust to Noise – Handles outliers and noisy data better than individual trees. Handles Large Datasets – Can scale well with more data. Feature Selection – Provides insights into the importance of features. No Need for Feature Scaling – Works with unscaled data, both numerical and categorical. \nCons\nLess Interpretable – Harder to visualize compared to a single decision tree. Computationally Intensive – Training many trees can take time and memory for large datasets. Overfitting Risk with Too Many Trees – Although rare, excessive trees might still overfit without tuning. Slower Inference – Predictions may take longer because they aggregate results from multiple trees. \nTips\n\nTune n_estimators – Adjust the number of trees to balance accuracy and computational cost.\nLimit Tree Depth – Use max_depth to avoid overfitting while maintaining performance.\nOptimize Feature Subset Size – Use max_features to control how many features each tree considers at a split.\nUse Feature Importance – Rank and prioritize the most important features in your dataset.\nCombine with Other Methods – Random Forest pairs well with techniques like PCA for dimensionality reduction. \n\nUseful Articles and Videos\nhttps://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/random-forests-classifier-python\nhttps://www.ibm.com/topics/random-forest\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHOazyP-YlM\n\n\nfrom sklearn import preprocessing\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\n\n\nCreate Model\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n\n\nTrain Model\n\ny.head()\n\n0    0\n1    1\n2    1\n3    1\n4    0\nName: Survived, dtype: int64\n\n\n\n\nMake Predictions\n\n# Predicting the Test set results\nRF = RandomForestClassifier()\nRF.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\nRandomForestClassifier()In a Jupyter environment, please rerun this cell to show the HTML representation or trust the notebook.

    "text": "XGBoost Classification is a supervised machine learning algorithm that builds an ensemble of decision trees to predict categorical outcomes. It is optimized for speed and performance using gradient boosting techniques.\n\nData For the foundation dataset we will be using the bank customer churn dataset. It is a commonly used dataset for predicting customer turnover in the banking industry. For more information go to the data folder’s readme file.\n\nDefinition\nXGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is an advanced implementation of gradient boosting designed for efficiency and accuracy. It improves predictions by sequentially training trees while correcting previous errors. The key components include:\n\nBoosting Trees: A collection of decision trees built sequentially to reduce errors.\n\nGradient Descent Optimization: Adjusts model weights using the gradient of a loss function.\n\nRegularization: Controls model complexity to prevent overfitting.\n\nFor classification, XGBoost predicts categorical outcomes by minimizing a chosen loss function, such as logistic loss for binary classification or softmax (cross-entropy) loss for multi-class classification.\n\nKey Concepts\n1. Boosting Mechanism:\n- Unlike a single decision tree, XGBoost builds multiple trees in sequence.\n- Each new tree corrects the errors of the previous ones by focusing on misclassified examples.\n\nLoss Functions:\n\nDetermines how errors are measured and minimized.\n\nCommon choices for classification include:\n\nLogistic Loss – Used for binary classification tasks.\n\nSoftmax (Cross-Entropy Loss) – Used for multi-class classification tasks.\n\n\nRegularization Techniques:\n\nPrevents overfitting by adding penalties to complex models.\n\nL1 Regularization (Lasso) – Encourages sparsity by shrinking coefficients.\n\nL2 Regularization (Ridge) – Penalizes large coefficients to reduce variance.\n\nFeature Importance & Selection:\n\nXGBoost ranks features by importance, aiding in feature selection.\n\nHelps in eliminating redundant or irrelevant features for better performance.\n\n\n\nPros\n1. High Performance – Optimized for speed, scalability, and efficiency.\n2. Handles Missing Data – Automatically learns how to deal with missing values.\n3. Regularization Built-in – Reduces overfitting with L1 and L2 penalties.\n4. Probabilistic Predictions – Provides probability scores for classification, enabling threshold tuning.\n5. Works Well with Large Datasets – Efficient memory usage and parallel processing.\n\nCons\n1. Complexity – More difficult to tune compared to simpler models.\n2. Computationally Intensive – Training can be slow on very large datasets.\n3. Sensitive to Hyperparameters – Performance depends on careful tuning of learning rate, tree depth, and regularization.\n4. Less Interpretable – Decision boundaries may be challenging to interpret compared to simpler models.\n\nTips\n* Optimize Hyperparameters – Use grid search or Bayesian optimization for tuning.\n* Use Early Stopping – Stop training if performance ceases to improve on validation data.\n* Scale Features if Needed – Although XGBoost can handle unscaled data, standardization might improve performance.\n* Leverage Feature Importance – Identify and remove less relevant features to improve efficiency.\n* Adjust Decision Thresholds – Fine-tune the probability threshold to balance precision and recall for your specific task.\n\nUseful Articles and Videos\n* XGBoost Official Documentation\n* XGBoost for Classification – Machine Learning Mastery\n* Understanding XGBoost – Analytics Vidhya\n* XGBoost Explained for Classification – YouTube\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Overview\nXGBoost Classification is a supervised machine learning algorithm that builds an ensemble of decision trees to predict categorical outcomes. It is optimized for speed and performance using gradient boosting techniques.\n\n\n\nDefinition\nXGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is an advanced implementation of gradient boosting designed for efficiency and accuracy. It improves predictions by sequentially training trees while correcting previous errors. The key components include:\n\nBoosting Trees: A collection of decision trees built sequentially to reduce errors.\n\nGradient Descent Optimization: Adjusts model weights using the gradient of a loss function.\n\nRegularization: Controls model complexity to prevent overfitting.\n\nFor classification, XGBoost predicts categorical outcomes by minimizing a chosen loss function, such as logistic loss for binary classification or softmax (cross-entropy) loss for multi-class classification.\n\n\n\nKey Concepts\n1. Boosting Mechanism:\n- Unlike a single decision tree, XGBoost builds multiple trees in sequence.\n- Each new tree corrects the errors of the previous ones by focusing on misclassified examples.\n\nLoss Functions:\n\nDetermines how errors are measured and minimized.\n\nCommon choices for classification include:\n\nLogistic Loss – Used for binary classification tasks.\n\nSoftmax (Cross-Entropy Loss) – Used for multi-class classification tasks.\n\n\nRegularization Techniques:\n\nPrevents overfitting by adding penalties to complex models.\n\nL1 Regularization (Lasso) – Encourages sparsity by shrinking coefficients.\n\nL2 Regularization (Ridge) – Penalizes large coefficients to reduce variance.\n\nFeature Importance & Selection:\n\nXGBoost ranks features by importance, aiding in feature selection.\n\nHelps in eliminating redundant or irrelevant features for better performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nPros\n1. High Performance – Optimized for speed, scalability, and efficiency.\n2. Handles Missing Data – Automatically learns how to deal with missing values.\n3. Regularization Built-in – Reduces overfitting with L1 and L2 penalties.\n4. Probabilistic Predictions – Provides probability scores for classification, enabling threshold tuning.\n5. Works Well with Large Datasets – Efficient memory usage and parallel processing.\n\n\n\nCons\n1. Complexity – More difficult to tune compared to simpler models.\n2. Computationally Intensive – Training can be slow on very large datasets.\n3. Sensitive to Hyperparameters – Performance depends on careful tuning of learning rate, tree depth, and regularization.\n4. Less Interpretable – Decision boundaries may be challenging to interpret compared to simpler models.\n\n\n\nTips\n* Optimize Hyperparameters – Use grid search or Bayesian optimization for tuning.\n* Use Early Stopping – Stop training if performance ceases to improve on validation data.\n* Scale Features if Needed – Although XGBoost can handle unscaled data, standardization might improve performance.\n* Leverage Feature Importance – Identify and remove less relevant features to improve efficiency.\n* Adjust Decision Thresholds – Fine-tune the probability threshold to balance precision and recall for your specific task.\n\n\n\nUseful Articles and Videos\n* XGBoost Official Documentation\n* XGBoost for Classification – Machine Learning Mastery\n* Understanding XGBoost – Analytics Vidhya\n* XGBoost Explained for Classification – YouTube",

    "text": "Decision Tree (DT) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It splits data into branches based on feature values to make predictions.\nDefinition A Decision Tree is a flowchart-like model where data is split into smaller subsets based on feature conditions. The structure consists of:\nRoot Node: The starting point that represents the entire dataset. Decision Nodes: Points where the data is split based on a feature. Leaves: Terminal nodes that provide the final prediction. For classification, a Decision Tree assigns class labels based on feature splits. For regression, it predicts continuous values using the average or mean of data points in each leaf.\nKey Concepts\nSplitting Criteria:\nDetermines how the dataset is divided at each step. Common methods: Gini Impurity (Classification) – Measures the likelihood of incorrect classification. Entropy (Classification) – Uses information gain to decide splits. Mean Squared Error (MSE) (Regression) – Measures variance within nodes. Tree Depth & Overfitting:\nDeeper trees fit training data better but may overfit. Pruning (removing unnecessary branches) improves generalization. Feature Importance:\nDecision Trees rank features by their impact on predictions. Helps in feature selection for other models. Handling Missing Data:\nSome implementations allow surrogate splits to handle missing values.\nPros\nEasy to Understand & Interpret – Can be visualized as a simple flowchart. No Need for Feature Scaling – Works with both categorical and numerical features. Handles Non-Linearity – Can model complex relationships without requiring transformation. Fast for Small Datasets – Training and inference are relatively quick.\nCons\nProne to Overfitting – Deep trees can memorize training data, reducing generalization. Unstable to Small Changes – Small variations in data can change the tree structure significantly. Less Efficient on Large Datasets – Computationally expensive for large datasets.\nTips\nLimit Tree Depth – Use max_depth to prevent overfitting. Pruning Techniques – Use pre-pruning (max_leaf_nodes) or post-pruning to remove unnecessary branches. Use Feature Importance – Identify the most influential features and remove irrelevant ones. Consider Ensemble Methods – Random Forest or Gradient Boosting improve Decision Trees by reducing variance.\nUseful Articles and Videos\nhttps://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/decision-tree-classification-python https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/decision-trees https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DlWndLbk90 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOiBe-nrmc4\nRandom Forest (RF) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It builds multiple decision trees and combines their outputs for better accuracy and stability.\nDefinition A Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that creates a “forest” of decision trees during training. Instead of relying on a single tree, Random Forest combines the predictions of multiple trees to improve performance. The structure consists of:\nDecision Trees: Individual trees that make predictions based on subsets of data and features. Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating): Each tree is trained on a randomly sampled subset of the data. Voting/Averaging: Combines the predictions from all trees: For classification, the majority vote decides the class. For regression, the average of all tree predictions is used. Random Forest reduces the risk of overfitting compared to individual decision trees and works well for both categorical and numerical data.\nKey Concepts\nBagging: Random Forest uses bootstrapping to train each tree on a different sample of the data. This creates diversity among trees, making the model more robust. Feature Randomness: At each split, Random Forest considers a random subset of features rather than all features. This reduces correlation between trees and improves generalization. Out-of-Bag (OOB) Error: Trees not trained on certain data points (left out during bootstrapping) can be used to validate the model. OOB error gives an unbiased estimate of model performance. Feature Importance: Random Forest provides a ranking of feature importance based on how often features are used for splitting across trees. Useful for identifying key predictors in your data. Pros\nImproved Accuracy – Combines multiple trees, reducing overfitting. Robust to Noise – Handles outliers and noisy data better than individual trees. Handles Large Datasets – Can scale well with more data. Feature Selection – Provides insights into the importance of features. No Need for Feature Scaling – Works with unscaled data, both numerical and categorical.\nCons\nLess Interpretable – Harder to visualize compared to a single decision tree. Computationally Intensive – Training many trees can take time and memory for large datasets. Overfitting Risk with Too Many Trees – Although rare, excessive trees might still overfit without tuning. Slower Inference – Predictions may take longer because they aggregate results from multiple trees.\nTips\nTune n_estimators – Adjust the number of trees to balance accuracy and computational cost. Limit Tree Depth – Use max_depth to avoid overfitting while maintaining performance. Optimize Feature Subset Size – Use max_features to control how many features each tree considers at a split. Use Feature Importance – Rank and prioritize the most important features in your dataset. Combine with Other Methods – Random Forest pairs well with techniques like PCA for dimensionality reduction.

    "text": "There are two datasets in the Data folder that will be used to learn regression. 1. New York City bicycle routes through bridges 2. Idaho Falls Chukars (Pioneer League Baseball) data to find the optimal amount of pitches to throw out a batter based on the teamID (player is a trench goal).\nOverview: XGBoost Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm that builds an ensemble of decision trees to predict continuous values. It is optimized for speed and performance using gradient boosting techniques.\n\nDefinition XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is an advanced implementation of gradient boosting designed for efficiency and accuracy. It improves predictions by sequentially training trees while correcting previous errors. The key components include:\n\nBoosting Trees: A collection of decision trees built sequentially to reduce errors.\n\nGradient Descent Optimization: Adjusts model weights using the gradient of a loss function.\n\nRegularization: Controls model complexity to prevent overfitting.\n\nFor regression, XGBoost predicts continuous values by minimizing a chosen loss function, commonly Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE).\n\nKey Concepts 1. Boosting Mechanism:\n- Unlike a single decision tree, XGBoost builds multiple trees in sequence.\n- Each new tree corrects the errors of the previous ones by focusing on residuals.\n\nLoss Functions:\n\nDetermines how errors are measured and minimized.\n\nCommon choices:\n\nMean Squared Error (MSE) – Penalizes larger errors more heavily.\n\nMean Absolute Error (MAE) – Treats all errors equally.\n\nHuber Loss – A mix of MSE and MAE to handle outliers.\n\n\nRegularization Techniques:\n\nPrevents overfitting by adding penalties to complex models.\n\nL1 Regularization (Lasso) – Shrinks coefficients, promoting sparsity.\n\nL2 Regularization (Ridge) – Penalizes large coefficients to reduce variance.\n\nFeature Importance & Selection:\n\nXGBoost ranks features by importance, aiding feature selection.\n\nCan be used to eliminate redundant or irrelevant features.\n\n\n\nPros 1. High Performance – Optimized for speed, scalability, and efficiency.\n2. Handles Missing Data – Automatically learns how to deal with missing values.\n3. Regularization Built-in – Reduces overfitting with L1 and L2 penalties.\n4. Works Well with Large Datasets – Efficient memory usage and parallel processing.\n\nCons 1. Complexity – More difficult to tune compared to simpler models.\n2. Computationally Intensive – Training can be slow on very large datasets.\n3. Sensitive to Hyperparameters – Performance depends on careful tuning of learning rate, tree depth, and regularization.\n\nTips * Optimize Hyperparameters – Use grid search or Bayesian optimization for tuning.\n* Use Early Stopping – Stops training if performance stops improving on validation data.\n* Scale Features if Needed – Although XGBoost can handle unscaled data, standardization may help in some cases.\n* Leverage Feature Importance – Identify and remove less relevant features to improve efficiency.\n\nUseful Articles and Videos\n* XGBoost Official Documentation\n* XGBoost for Regression – Machine Learning Mastery\n* Understanding XGBoost – Analytics Vidhya\n* XGBoost Explained – YouTube\n\n\n\n Back to top"
