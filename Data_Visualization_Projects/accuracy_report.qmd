# What is it?      
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to track and evaluate transfer course accuracy across schools and departments. The dashboard includes filters for date range, I-Number (student lookup), and school/transfer type categories (e.g., duplicated transfer, waivers, invalid grade).  

# Impact  

Improved transparency and accountability in transfer credit evaluation, ensured data accuracy for student records, and provided actionable insights to support policy compliance and academic decision-making.
