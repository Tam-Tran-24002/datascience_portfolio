# What is it?      
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to monitor and analyze student account holds with filters for hold type, date range, and student demographics (international vs. domestic students).      

Built key visualizations including monthly resolved holds (using DAX for time-based calculations), top hold types, risk-tier distribution, unresolved hold comparisons, and semester-aligned reference lines.      

Designed dynamic filters and clear visualizations to support decision-making by the registration team.  

# Impact  
Improved transparency of student hold trends, enabled actionable insights for decision-makers, and enhanced reporting flexibility.
