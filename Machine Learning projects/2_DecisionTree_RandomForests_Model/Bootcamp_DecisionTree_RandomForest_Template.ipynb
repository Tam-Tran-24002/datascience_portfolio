        "A Decision Tree is a flowchart-like model where data is split into smaller subsets based on feature conditions. The structure consists of:  \n",
        "\n",
        "* **Root Node**: The starting point that represents the entire dataset.  \n",
        "* **Decision Nodes**: Points where the data is split based on a feature.  \n",
        "* **Leaves**: Terminal nodes that provide the final prediction.  \n",
        "\n",
        "For **classification**, a Decision Tree assigns class labels based on feature splits.  \n",
        "For **regression**, it predicts continuous values using the average or mean of data points in each leaf.  \n",

        "1. **Splitting Criteria**:  \n",
        "   - Determines how the dataset is divided at each step.  \n",
        "   - Common methods:\n",
        "     * **Gini Impurity** (Classification) – Measures the likelihood of incorrect classification.  \n",
        "     * **Entropy** (Classification) – Uses information gain to decide splits.  \n",
        "     * **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** (Regression) – Measures variance within nodes.  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Tree Depth & Overfitting**:  \n",
        "   - **Deeper trees** fit training data better but may overfit.  \n",
        "   - **Pruning** (removing unnecessary branches) improves generalization.  \n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Feature Importance**:  \n",
        "   - Decision Trees rank features by their impact on predictions.  \n",
        "   - Helps in feature selection for other models.  \n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Handling Missing Data**:  \n",

        "* **Use Feature Importance** – Identify the most influential features and remove irrelevant ones.  \n",

        "\n",
        "**Definition**  \n",
        "A Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that creates a \"forest\" of decision trees during training. Instead of relying on a single tree, Random Forest combines the predictions of multiple trees to improve performance. The structure consists of:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Decision Trees: Individual trees that make predictions based on subsets of data and features.\n",
        "- Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating): Each tree is trained on a randomly sampled subset of the data.\n",
        "- Voting/Averaging: Combines the predictions from all trees:\n",
        "- For classification, the majority vote decides the class.\n",
        "- For regression, the average of all tree predictions is used.  \n",
        "Random Forest reduces the risk of overfitting compared to individual decision trees and works well for both categorical and numerical data.\n",

        "<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Concepts**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Bagging:\n",
        "  - Random Forest uses bootstrapping to train each tree on a different sample of the data.\n",
        "  - This creates diversity among trees, making the model more robust.\n",
        "2. Feature Randomness:\n",
        "  - At each split, Random Forest considers a random subset of features rather than all features.\n",
        "  - This reduces correlation between trees and improves generalization.\n",
        "3. Out-of-Bag (OOB) Error:\n",
        "  - Trees not trained on certain data points (left out during bootstrapping) can be used to validate the model.\n",
        "  - OOB error gives an unbiased estimate of model performance.\n",
        "4. Feature Importance:\n",
        "  - Random Forest provides a ranking of feature importance based on how often features are used for splitting across trees.\n",
        "  - Useful for identifying key predictors in your data.\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "**Pros**\n",
        "\n",
        "Improved Accuracy – Combines multiple trees, reducing overfitting.\n",
        "Robust to Noise – Handles outliers and noisy data better than individual trees.\n",
        "Handles Large Datasets – Can scale well with more data.\n",
        "Feature Selection – Provides insights into the importance of features.\n",
        "No Need for Feature Scaling – Works with unscaled data, both numerical and categorical.\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "**Cons**\n",
        "\n",
        "Less Interpretable – Harder to visualize compared to a single decision tree.\n",
        "Computationally Intensive – Training many trees can take time and memory for large datasets.\n",
        "Overfitting Risk with Too Many Trees – Although rare, excessive trees might still overfit without tuning.\n",
        "Slower Inference – Predictions may take longer because they aggregate results from multiple trees.\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "**Tips**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Tune n_estimators – Adjust the number of trees to balance accuracy and computational cost.\n",
        "* Limit Tree Depth – Use max_depth to avoid overfitting while maintaining performance.\n",
        "* Optimize Feature Subset Size – Use max_features to control how many features each tree considers at a split.\n",
        "* Use Feature Importance – Rank and prioritize the most important features in your dataset.\n",
        "* Combine with Other Methods – Random Forest pairs well with techniques like PCA for dimensionality reduction.\n",
